    <h2>Dear: Lelly</h2>
    <p>
        I know this will not compare to the gifts you are receive from that <b>BUM</b>. I hope its enough to show you how much you mean to me
    </p>
    <p>
      You mean so much too me and what I did last year is my biggest regret I should have never let you go. I miss you Lelly actually I miss us,
we have something that goes beyond physical connection. You are my everything ( my wife, my queen, my best friend and my future).   
    </p>
    <p>
        Honestly I am selfish because I just want you... all of you to myself and I can not lose to someone who you have known just for a
month (I do not want to lose you to anyone). I want to marry you and be by your side through thick and thin. I want to be the when 
you graduate, when you cry, when you hurt, and when you reach the top. I want to be the one who is there for you in every moment of your life. I want to be the one who makes you smile and laugh, the one who supports you and encourages you, and the one who loves you unconditionally.
    </p>
    <p>
       What we have is no ordinary love... we were to be together. You can even say we are star crossed lovers.
I am here to stay and for good cause you mine and I am yours❤️. 
    </p>
    <p>
        YOURS FOREVER AND ALWAYS,
        <br>
        Taffy
